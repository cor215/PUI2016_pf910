1. For the first assignment, I followed the instruction which help us to know how to create 100 random sample. And do distribution test for each of them and then plot them.
For the extra credit point, Danny helped me.
2. For the second assignment, Adrian and I teamed up, we unzip a January 2016 Citibike data, then decided two have our Hypothesis and drop the unwanted columns and then plot scatter of our two remained columns.
3. This assignment1`f1 which we have to read from raw of Federico repository by Curl commands and then put it in to a dictionary and calculate the mean of it. Then we use Z-test formula to make sure if our Null hypo, which was the current rout will not decrease the time of commute is feasible or not. The formula gives us a value that we put it in p-value equation. And since the value that be produced by p-p-p-value is less than our significance level then the null hypo is rejected. 
Danny explained this assignment to me.
