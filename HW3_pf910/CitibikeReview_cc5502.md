##Assignment I: Peer Review of Citibike Assignment

* Author: Chongyang (Connor) Chen


In her assignment, Pooneh wants to investigate the relationship between age and time of trip. The null and alternative hypothesis statements are accurate based on the idea. 

Pooneh selected the right data columns and generated a scatterplot of the relationship between birth year and trip duration. 

However, it seems that she needs more work on transforming the birthyear variable to age, and also come up with a way of quantifying the relationship between age and trip duration. 

I'd recommend doing a OLS regression and see if the result of the coefficient of the independent variable (age) has a 95% confidence interval that does not cover zero. This seems the quickest way she could do the proposed hypothsis.
